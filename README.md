# zero-shot-learning guidebook
In order to familiarize more people with zero-shot-learning, we create the reposiyory to introduce some basic knowledge about it. Next, we will introduce it in three parts, respectively what, why, how.
## What is zeor-shot-learning?

In the convolutional classfication model, we need a large number of data to train the model. So when we categorize a new class, we have to collect data again.

In order to resolve such problem, Lampert proposed a classic attribute-based approach called zero-shot-learning. Let's take a look at its structure.

As we can see from the structure, we give a set of data which include seen class、model、side information and unsenn class. Seen class and unseen class are disjoint. Now we can conclude that zero-shot-learning is a method that we can predict the unseen data. 


## Why do i introduce it?

## How should we learn it?
